Automation is often underestimated in the world of programming. Let's be clear—becoming a DevOps master isn't a
prerequisite for everyone. However, for those who recognize the value in automating their programming tasks, the
benefits are undeniable.

# What can be automated?

1. **Building Process:**

   Initially, automating the build process might seem dull. Isn't it just quicker to click a button or type a command to
   build your program? Well, yes, but combining automation with subsequent steps can save you more time and effort than
   you realize. For instance, imagine a scenario where your project needs to be built, tested, and deployed to multiple
   environments. Automating this process ensures consistency and reduces the risk of human error. Moreover, automation
   allows for parallel execution of tasks, thereby accelerating the overall development lifecycle.
2. **Tests:**

   Automating tests can be a game-changer. Make a small change and see if your entire application still functions.
   Sometimes, the smallest alterations wreak areas you least expect. Automated testing not only helps
   identify critical bugs faster and more frequently but also aids in bug fixes. Instead of manually sifting through
   version history, automation streamlines the process. Additionally, automated tests serve as a safety net during
   refactoring or adding new features, providing developers with confidence in their changes.
3. **Dependencies:**

   In multi-repo projects, creating your own utility libraries can save time and headaches. Automatically updating
   dependencies in other projects where these utilities are used might seem trivial, but it prevents potential issues
   down the line. Moreover, keeping dependencies up-to-date is crucial for security and performance reasons. Automating
   dependency management ensures that your projects are using the latest stable versions, reducing the risk of
   vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.
4. **Monitoring and Alerting:**

   Discussing how automation can be used to monitor application performance, detect anomalies, and trigger alerts can
   highlight its role in maintaining system health and reliability. This could include exploring different monitoring
   tools, key metrics to track, and automated responses to common issues.
5. **Scaling Infrastructure:**

   Exploring how automation can streamline the process of scaling infrastructure to meet growing demand can be valuable
   for readers managing cloud-based applications. This could involve discussing auto-scaling mechanisms,
   infrastructure-as-code tools, and strategies for optimizing resource utilization.
6. **Security Automation:**

   Discussing how automation can enhance security practices, such as vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, and
   incident response, can help readers understand its role in safeguarding software systems. This could include
   exploring security automation tools, integration with existing workflows, and the benefits of shifting security left
   in the development lifecycle.
7. **DevOps Practices:**

   Introducing DevOps practices alongside automation emphasizes the importance of collaboration between development and
   operations teams. DevOps promotes a culture of shared responsibility, continuous feedback, and iterative improvement.
   Automation plays a central role in DevOps by enabling seamless integration and delivery of software, reducing manual
   intervention, and fostering a more efficient and agile development process.

# When to Start Implementing Pipelines

The biggest indicator for diving into pipelines is the scale of your projects. While automating the publication of a
single website upon pushing changes to the main branch can be quite useful, especially with the ability to view it live
in a testing environment without the need for setting up a server, the true value of pipelines becomes evident as your
projects multiply and intertwine.

As projects become increasingly branched and interconnected, investing effort into automating the testing and building
processes becomes imperative. Think of it as an investment—the sooner you start, the sooner you reap the benefits.

Of course, the extent to which you delve into pipelines is entirely up to you. For example, in a massive application
like GitLab, having hundreds of pipelines for a single project is essential. Yet, what's even more impressive is that
GitLab is building itself using these very pipelines.

At code0, we've experienced firsthand the time-saving wonders of pipelines, especially in areas typically deemed tedious
but crucial, such as documentation. We've streamlined our documentation process by creating a docs folder within every
project that requires documentation. Within these folders, we simply jot down the necessary documentation while working
on the project. Once completed, we push the changes, and a pipeline automatically integrates them into our documentation
software, publishing the updates seamlessly. No more switching between projects to document changes, no manual building
and release processes for documentation, and no more worries about software updates.

You might start to see the pattern now. By automating documentation, we not only save time but also free up mental
bandwidth for the tasks that truly matter. This approach enables us to channel more energy into essential matters
without neglecting potential trouble spots in the future.
